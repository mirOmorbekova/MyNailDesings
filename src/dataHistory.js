        description: "In ancient Egypt, manicure served as an indicator of social status. The darker the color of the nails, the richer their owner was considered. So, Queen Cleopatra loved rich terracotta, which was achieved with the help of henna, and Nefertiti preferred ruby. Representatives of the lowest class – slaves – could afford only natural beige shades. At the same time, even then hand care included not only a color coating, but also moisturizing and nourishing the skin with natural oils. It is known that the first manicure masters also appeared in ancient Egypt. In 1964, archaeologists discovered the mummies of two court servants of Pharaoh Niuserra, whose duties included performing the royal manicure.",

        description: "The first nail paint appeared in ancient China. It included beeswax, egg whites, gelatin, jam and flower petals. The result was a coating of pink and red shades, which froze for several hours. Like the Egyptians, the Chinese considered manicure a privilege of wealthy people from the upper classes. The main indicator was the length of the nails – Chinese women wore gold and silver tips with precious stones, as natural nails often broke.",

        description: "In the Middle Ages in Europe, manicure was equated with witchcraft, and the owner of colored nails was burned at the stake. However, even at this time, girls and men took care of themselves, giving the nail plate a glossy shine with a small board covered with suede. If it was already difficult to surprise with colored nails by the 19th century, then manicure as a cuticle treatment originated only in 1830. The reason for this was a painful burr of the King of France Louis Philippe I. Dr. Sittz was the only doctor who helped the monarch with an orange stick, powder and suede file, which he took from dentists. As a result, such sets became popular with many of those times. By the end of the century, the first professional manicure masters appeared, working in salons in the centers of Europe. They treated the nails, polished them and lightened the tips of the nails with vinegar.",
